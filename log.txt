Re-run this program with -h or -help CLI argument to see a help menu or refer to README for instructions.

NOTE: If 1 is selected below, you will NOT be prompted further for any eval function or algorithm. All will be simulated in order.

Choose a game mode below: 
     1. Full Simulation (recommended)
     2. Single Custom Simulation
     3. Player vs Player (manual game)
     4. Player vs AI (will be asked to select AI playstyle)
     Ctrl + C to terminate program at any time.
