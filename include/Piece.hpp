/**
 * Header definition for class Piece. 
 * A "piece" is a checker piece used in the game of checkers. 
 * It may be either red or black. Color is an immutable property. 
 * It is set only once when the piece is created and placed on the board. 
 * 
 * A standard checkers piece may move only forwards in a diagonal manner. If the piece reaches the 
 * opposite end of the board, it becomes a "king" piece. This means it may now move backwards diagonally. 
 * A piece's position is determined by it's board placement - row and column number.
